 car price prediction machine learning model predicts the price of a car based on various features using historical data. Here's a brief overview:

Key Features:
Inputs (Features):
Make and Model: Car brand and specific model.
Year: Production year, with newer cars generally costing more.
Mileage: Total distance traveled by the car, where lower mileage typically means a higher price.
Engine Size & Type: E.g., electric, diesel, or petrol engines.
Transmission & Fuel Type: Manual or automatic transmission, petrol, diesel, or electric fuel type.
Car Condition: New, used, or damaged.
Location: The region or market affects car prices.
Other Add-ons: Features like sunroof, leather seats, etc.
Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Data: Filling or removing missing values.
Feature Encoding: Converting categorical data (e.g., model, make) into numeric form.
Scaling/Normalization: Standardizing features like mileage for consistency.
Outlier Removal: Removing extreme data points to prevent model distortion.
Model Selection:
Common algorithms include:

Linear Regression: For linear relationships.
Decision Trees & Random Forest: For non-linear patterns and feature interactions.
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost): For complex patterns.
Evaluation:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) are key metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
This type of model helps estimate car prices efficiently using features like mileage, year, and brand.
